Single Fetch vs. Multiple Fetches
First Fetch (Single Request):

The first fetch request retrieves a single JSON array of job story IDs.
We use await to ensure that the data is fetched and parsed into JSON before proceeding.
Only one network request is needed.
Second Fetch (Multiple Requests):

The second fetch requires fetching details for each job story ID.
We need to make multiple network requests, one for each job story ID.
This can result in many asynchronous operations that need to be handled concurrently.
